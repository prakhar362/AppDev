## 🧠 Design Decisions & Thought Process

I adopted a sophisticated dark theme, accented with colors that enhance readability and reduce eye strain. The color scheme was selected to reflect the aesthetics of modern trading apps while maintaining a strong visual hierarchy and consistency. I also referred to several trading app designs for inspiration, incorporating animations and looking for quality visuals, GIFs, and appealing designs that enhance user experience and showcase my UI skills.
